    "In recent years, many of our favorite artists have been telling stories of their mental states as well as personal stories. For example, rapper Mac Miller wrote about his drug usage, which foreshadowed his death in 2018. Mac Miller, Lil Peep, Avicii, and Chester Bennington are just some contemporary artists whose personal struggles (expressed through their music) and untimely demises have created shockwaves across the industry. But this trend has roots in incidents that reach back to at least the 1970’s, with the formation of the infamous 27 Club. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and many others have contributed in creating an almost cult-like reverence for the tragic ending of a musician’s life via their own demons and vices. The struggles of modern musicians and the long history of overlooking their underlying issues inspired us to look at whether or not lyrical analyses of their works and activities can help predict self-harm behavior and action for artists in the future.\n",

We will try to eliminate foreign artists since, from what we have seen, the data we are dealing with is mostly on English speaking artists. If a song is in a foreign language, we won’t be able to process it alongside English lyrics (translating to English will also cause us to lose nuances present in a song’s origin language), as there is no good metric for measuring meaning and mood across languages. We need to also ensure that the scraped data from BeautifulSoup is in good format.\n",

    "From those words, we can infer if selected song lyrics have a statistically significant correlation to artists that have passed as a result of self-harm and/or abusive habits. We can also utilize more analysis functions from the NLP library to possibly see the sentimental values. Those can accompany our very basic inference and observations we make to strengthen our result. To aid our conclusion and visualizations, we can create dist plots to see if certain words stand out across all artists. We can also create dist plots to show that if certain words have a significant weight for a particular artist (not just high frequency, but also high density). We can also potentially plot cause of death vs. word frequency to further see if there is a correlation between lyrics and substance of abuse. \n",

    "The main dataset we will be using is the Genius API in combination with a Kaggle dataset. It can provide lyrics for songs that are on the Genius website and is free to use.  To further expand on our song sample set, we will be using the “Every Song You Have Heard (almost!)” dataset from Kaggle. These datasets, unless specified, are considered free to use for the public.  We were initially hoping to find medical records for the selected artists, however, it was clear that that information is not easily accessible. According to Trisha Torrey, there are “two general types of medical records that are shared or purchased,” and neither can be given out to the general public. It may also violate Safe Harbour rules. We are also going to be selecting the artists for analysis using online resources, such as Wikipedia and Rolling Stone. Furthermore, the other websites, such as Wikipedia and Ranker, used to obtain celebrity data. They are public sites that we will need to cite. The final problem would be the danger of web scraping information from various websites. As long as we follow their terms of services, we should be allowed to get information, however, it should be done carefully (“Web Scraping”)\n",

    "The most apparent bias within our dataset, would be the overrepresentation of famous/celebrity artists. Artists whose lyrics we will choose to analyze will likely be celebrity artists, since more people are more familiar with their work, as a general rule of thumb. Non-lyrical data will likely be taken from heuristically-organized lists (lists written by magazine editors that generally feature artists fresh in public memory, or celebrity artists), which will also influence the composition of the subset of artists we will choose to analyze. They will not be representative of the average artist or musician. Celebrity artists’ lifestyles may add bias to our data because their increased popularity leads to intensified scrutiny under the public eye, possibly leading to altered behavior, compared to the average artist. Furthermore, our study will touch on a sensitive topic of mental health. Although the project will be looking at the matter of mental health objectively, we are still going to be  examining an individual’s personal life. This problem can be solved by making sure our analysis is based solely upon the data that we observe or get, and is focused on the relationships that arise between lyrical content, cause of death, and words that are indicative of current mental health.\n",

    "Hundreds of thousands of people around the globe die by suicide every year. Non-fatal self-harm cases are 20 times more common than fatal cases. In addition to personal and healthcare costs, the risks of future suicide and self-harm increase every time someone hurts themself. Early identification of those at high risk of future self-harm is crucial to our population’s well-being. With the right findings, we can better identify high-risk individuals and raise mental health awareness, preventing self-harm or suicide. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our methods do not work or our hypothesis is wrong, future research should go back and look into which words and what the lyrics are perceived as being most salient in signifying mental health status. We must be mindful of and consider the individual when it comes to mental health treatment to achieve the best possible outcome. One finding that would be intriguing would be to see if we can definitively find similar semantic content amongst songs that can be attributed to certain messages or thoughts signifying troubling mental health conditions. Conversely, discovering content amongst songs that can be attributed to messages or thoughts that can help lower symptoms of frequently occurring mental health illnesses, such as depression or anxiety, would also be incredibly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed study poses a large limitation. Because we will be filtering by syntax instead of semantics, it is possible we label an artist as high-risk due to the inclusion of search words. It is entirely possible the lyrics of mentally-capable artists contain some of our key words, which will mistakenly label them as high-risk.  It will be incredibly difficult to gather data based on meaning due to machine limitations. Unfortunately, we currently are not sure of our capability to gather data based upon lyric meaning and will have to rely on a large data sample and proper keywords to reduce the number of outliers.\n"
